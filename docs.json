See Pub. 550 for details.\nBasis and Recordkeeping\nBasis is the amount of your investment \nin property for tax purposes. The basis \nof property you buy is usually its cost. \nThere are special rules for certain kinds \nof property, such as inherited property. \nYou need to know your basis to figure \nany gain or loss on the sale or other dis-\nposition of the property. You must keep \naccurate records that show the basis and, \nif applicable, adjusted basis of your \nproperty. Your records should show the \npurchase price, including commissions; \nincreases to basis, such as the cost of \nimprovements; and decreases to basis, \nsuch as depreciation, nondividend distri-\nbutions on stock, and stock splits.\nIf you received a Schedule A to Form \n8971 from an executor of an estate or \nother person required to file an estate tax \nreturn, you may be required to report a \nbasis consistent with the estate tax value \nof the property.\nFor more information on consistent \nbasis reporting and basis generally, see \nColumn (e)—Cost or Other Basis in the \nInstructions for Form 8949, and the fol-\nlowing publications.\n• Pub. 551, Basis of Assets.\n• Pub. 550, Investment Income and\nExpenses.\nShort- or Long-Term Gain or \nLoss\nReport short-term gains or losses in Part \nI. Report long-term gains or losses in \nPart \nII. \nThe \nholding \nperiod \nfor \nshort-term capital gains and losses is \ngenerally 1 year or less. The holding pe-\nriod for long-term capital gains and los-\nses is generally more than 1 year. How-\never, beginning in 2018, the long-term \nholding period for certain gains with re-\nspect to “applicable partnership inter-\nests” is more than 3 years. See Pub. 541 \nfor more information.\nTIP\nFor more information about holding \nperiods, see the Instructions for Form \n8949.\nCapital Gain Distributions\nThese distributions are paid by a mutual \nfund (or other regulated investment \ncompany) or real estate investment trust \nfrom its net realized long-term capital \ngains. Distributions of net realized \nshort-term capital gains aren't treated as \ncapital gains. Instead, they are included \non Form 1099-DIV as ordinary divi-\ndends.\nEnter on Schedule D, line 13, the to-\ntal capital gain distributions paid to you \nduring the year, regardless of how long \nyou held your investment. This amount \nis shown in box 2a of Form 1099-DIV.\nIf there is an amount in box 2b, in-\nclude that amount on line 11 of the Un-\nrecaptured Section 1250 Gain Work-\nsheet in these instructions if you com-\nplete line 19 of Schedule D.\nIf there is an amount in box 2c, see \nExclusion of Gain on Qualified Small \nBusiness (QSB) Stock, later.\nIf there is an amount in box 2d, in-\nclude that amount on line 4 of the 28% \nRate Gain Worksheet in these instruc-\ntions if you complete line 18 of Sched-\nule D.\nIf you received capital gain distribu-\ntions as a nominee (that is, they were \npaid to you but actually belong to some-\none else), report on Schedule D, line 13, \nonly the amount that belongs to you. At-\ntach a statement showing the full \namount you received and the amount \nyou received as a nominee. See the In-\nstructions for Schedule B to learn about \nthe requirement for you to file Forms \n1099-DIV and 1096.\nSale of Your Home\nYou may not need to report the sale or \nexchange of your main home. If you \nmust report it, complete Form 8949 be-\nfore Schedule D.\nReport the sale or exchange of your \nmain home on Form 8949 if:\n• You can't exclude all of your gain \nfrom income, or\n• You received a Form 1099-S for \nthe sale or exchange.\nAny gain you can't exclude is taxable. \nGenerally, if you meet the following two \nD-2\n",
        "tests, you can exclude up to $250,000 of \ngain. If both you and your spouse meet \nthese tests and you file a joint return, \nyou can exclude up to $500,000 of gain \n(but only one spouse needs to meet the \nownership requirement in Test 1).\nTest 1. During the 5-year period ending \non the date you sold or exchanged your \nhome, you owned it for 2 years or more \n(the ownership requirement) and lived in \nit as your main home for 2 years or more \n(the use requirement).\nTest 2. You haven't excluded gain on \nthe sale or exchange of another main \nhome during the 2-year period ending on \nthe date of the sale or exchange of your \nhome.\nReduced exclusion. Even if you don't \nmeet one or both of the above two tests, \nyou can still claim an exclusion if you \nsold or exchanged the home because of \na change in place of employment, \nhealth, or certain unforeseen circumstan-\nces. In this case, the maximum amount \nof gain you can exclude is reduced. For \nmore information, see Pub. 523.\nSale of home by surviving spouse. If \nyour spouse died before the sale or ex-\nchange, you can still exclude up to \n$500,000 of gain if:\n• The sale or exchange is no later \nthan 2 years after your spouse's death;\n• Just before your spouse's death, \nboth spouses met the use requirement of \nTest 1, at least one spouse met the own-\nership requirement of Test 1, and both \nspouses met Test 2; and\n• You didn't remarry before the sale \nor exchange.\nExceptions to Test 1. You can choose \nto have the 5-year test period for owner-\nship and use in Test 1 suspended during \nany period you or your spouse serves \noutside the United States as a Peace \nCorps volunteer or serves on qualified \nofficial extended duty as a member of \nthe uniformed services or Foreign Serv-\nice of the United States, as an employee \nof the intelligence community, or out-\nside the United States as an employee of \nthe Peace Corps. This means you may \nbe able to meet Test 1 even if, because \nof your service, you didn't actually use \nthe home as your main home for at least \nthe required 2 years during the 5-year \nperiod ending on the date of sale. The \n5-year period can't be extended for more \nthan 10 years.\nExample. Tamara buys a house in \nVirginia in 2011 that she uses as her \nmain home for 3 years. For 8 years, \nfrom 2014 through 2022, Tamara serves \non qualified official extended duty as a \nmember of the uniformed services in \nKuwait. In 2023, Tamara sells the house. \nTamara didn't use the house as her main \nhome for at least 2 of the 5 years before \nthe sale. To meet Test 1, Tamara elects to \nsuspend the 5-year test period during her \n8-year period of uniformed service in \nKuwait. Because that 8-year period \nwon't be counted in determining if she \nused the house as her main home for 2 \nof the 5 years before the sale, she meets \nthe ownership and use requirements of \nTest 1.\nQualified extended duty. You are on \nqualified extended duty if:\n• You are called or ordered to active \nduty for an indefinite period or for a pe-\nriod of more than 90 days; and\n• You are serving at a duty station at \nleast 50 miles from your main home, or \nyou are living in government quarters \nunder government orders.\nSale of home acquired in a like-kind \nexchange. You can't exclude any gain \nif:\n• You acquired your home in a \nlike-kind exchange in which all or part \nof the gain wasn't recognized, and\n• You sold or exchanged the home \nduring the 5-year period beginning on \nthe date you acquired it.\nHow to report the sale of your main \nhome. If you have to report the sale or \nexchange, report it on Form 8949. If the \ngain or loss is short term, report it in \nPart I of Form 8949 with box C \nchecked. If the gain or loss is long term, \nreport it in Part II of Form 8949 with \nbox F checked.\nIf you had a gain and can exclude \npart or all of it, enter “H” in column (f) \nof Form 8949. Enter the exclusion as a \nnegative number (in parentheses) in col-\numn (g) of Form 8949. See the instruc-\ntions for Form 8949, columns (f), (g), \nand (h). Complete all columns.\nIf you had a loss but have to report \nthe sale or exchange because you got a \nForm 1099-S, see Nondeductible Losses, \nlater, for instructions about how to re-\nport it.\nMore information. See Pub. 523 for \nadditional details, including how to fig-\nure and report any taxable gain if:\n• You (or your spouse if married) \nused any part of the home for business \nor rental purposes after May 6, 1997; or\n• There was a period of time after \n2008 when the home wasn't your main \nhome.\nPartnership Interests\nA sale or other disposition of an interest \nin a partnership may result in ordinary \nincome, collectibles gain (28% rate \ngain), or unrecaptured section 1250 \ngain. For details on 28% rate gain, see \nthe instructions for line 18. For details \non unrecaptured section 1250 gain, see \nthe instructions for line 19.\nCapital Assets Held for \nPersonal Use\nGenerally, gain from the sale or ex-\nchange of a capital asset held for person-\nal use is a capital gain. Report it on \nForm 8949 with box C checked (if the \ntransaction is short term) or box F \nchecked (if the transaction is long term). \nHowever, if you converted depreciable \nproperty to personal use, all or part of \nthe gain on the sale or exchange of that \nproperty may have to be recaptured as \nordinary income. Use Part III of Form \n4797 to figure the amount of ordinary \nincome recapture. The recapture amount \nis included on line 31 (and line 13) of \nForm 4797. Don't enter any gain from \nthis property on line 32 of Form 4797. If \nyou aren't completing Part III for any \nother properties, enter “N/A” on line 32. \nIf the total gain is more than the recap-\nture amount, enter “From Form 4797” in \ncolumn (a) of Part I of Form 8949 (if the \ntransaction is short term) or Part II of \nForm 8949 (if the transaction is long \nterm), and skip columns (b) and (c). In \ncolumn (d) of Form 8949, enter the ex-\ncess of the total gain over the recapture \namount. Leave columns (e) through (g) \nblank. Complete column (h). Be sure to \ncheck box C at the top of Part I or box F \nat the top of Part II of this Form 8949 \n(depending on how long you held the as-\nset).\nLoss from the sale or exchange of a \ncapital asset held for personal use isn't \ndeductible. But if you had a loss from \nthe sale or exchange of real estate held \nfor personal use for which you received \nD-3\n",
        "a Form 1099-S, you must report the \ntransaction on Form 8949 even though \nthe loss isn't deductible. Also, if you had \na loss from the sale or exchange of per-\nsonal property for which you received a \nForm 1099-K, you must report the trans-\naction on Form 8949 or on Schedule 1 \n(Form 1040) even though the loss isn’t \ndeductible.\nExample. You have a loss on the \nsale of a vacation home that isn't your \nmain home and you received a Form \n1099-S for the transaction. Report the \ntransaction in Part I or Part II of Form \n8949, depending on how long you \nowned the home. Complete all columns. \nBecause the loss isn't deductible, enter \n“L” in column (f). Enter the difference \nbetween column (d) and column (e) as a \npositive amount in column (g). Then \ncomplete column (h). (For example, if \nyou entered $5,000 in column (d) and \n$6,000 in column (e), enter $1,000 in \ncolumn (g). Then enter -0- ($5,000 − \n$6,000 + $1,000) in column (h). Be sure \nto check box C at the top of Part I or box \nF at the top of Part II of this Form 8949 \n(depending on how long you owned the \nhome).)\nCapital Losses\nYou can deduct capital losses up to the \namount of your capital gains plus $3,000 \n($1,500 if married filing separately). \nYou may be able to use capital losses \nthat exceed this limit in future years. For \ndetails, see the instructions for line 21. \nBe sure to report all of your capital gains \nand losses even if you can't use all of \nyour losses in 2023.\nCertain Nondeductible \nLosses\nYou can’t deduct a loss from a sale or \nexchange between certain related par-\nties. This includes a direct or indirect \nsale or exchange of property between \nany of the following.\n• Members of a family.\n• A corporation and an individual \nwho directly (or indirectly) owns more \nthan 50% of the corporation's stock (un-\nless the loss is from a distribution in \ncomplete liquidation of a corporation).\n• A grantor and a fiduciary of a \ntrust.\n• A fiduciary and a beneficiary of \nthe same trust.\n• A fiduciary of a trust and a fiducia-\nry (or beneficiary) of another trust if \nboth trusts were created by the same \ngrantor.\n• An executor of an estate and a ben-\neficiary of that estate, unless the sale or \nexchange was to satisfy a pecuniary be-\nquest (that is, a bequest of a sum of \nmoney).\n• An individual and a tax-exempt or-\nganization controlled directly (or indi-\nrectly) by the individual or the individu-\nal's family.\nSee Pub. 544 for more details on \nsales and exchanges between related \nparties.\nReport a transaction that results in a \nnondeductible loss in Part I or Part II of \nForm 8949 (depending on how long you \nheld the property). Unless you received \na Form 1099-B for the sale or exchange, \ncheck box C at the top of Part I or box F \nat the top of Part II of this Form 8949 \n(depending on how long you owned the \nproperty). Complete all columns. Be-\ncause the loss isn't deductible, enter “L” \nin column (f). Enter the amount of the \nnondeductible loss as a positive number \nin column (g). Complete column (h). \nSee the instructions for Form 8949, col-\numns (f), (g), and (h).\nExample 1. You sold land you held \nas an investment for 5 years to your \nbrother for $10,000. Your basis was \n$15,000. On Part II of Form 8949, check \nbox F at the top. Enter $10,000 on Form \n8949, Part II, column (d). Enter $15,000 \nin column (e). Because the loss isn't de-\nductible, enter “L” in column (f) and \n$5,000 (the difference between $10,000 \nand $15,000) in column (g). In column \n(h), enter -0- ($10,000 − $15,000 + \n$5,000). If this is your only transaction \non this Form 8949, enter $10,000 on \nSchedule D, line 10, column (d). Enter \n$15,000 in column (e) and $5,000 in \ncolumn (g). In column (h), enter -0- \n($10,000 − $15,000 + $5,000).\nExample 2. You received a Form \n1099-B showing proceeds (sales price) \nof $1,000 and basis of $5,000. Box 7 on \nForm 1099-B is checked, indicating that \nyour loss of $4,000 ($1,000 − $5,000) \nisn't allowed. On the top of Form 8949, \ncheck box A or box B in Part I or box D \nor box E in Part II (whichever applies). \nEnter $1,000 in column (d) and $5,000 \nin column (e). Because the loss isn't de-\nductible, enter “L” in column (f) and \n$4,000 (the difference between $1,000 \nand $5,000) in column (g). In column \n(h), enter -0- ($1,000 − $5,000 + \n$4,000).\nAt-risk rules. If you disposed of (a) an \nasset used in an activity to which the \nat-risk rules apply, or (b) any part of \nyour interest in an activity to which the \nat-risk rules apply, and you have \namounts in the activity for which you \naren't at risk, see the Instructions for \nForm 6198.\nPassive activity rules. If the loss is al-\nlowable under the at-risk rules, it may be \nsubject to the passive activity rules. See \nForm 8582 and its instructions for de-\ntails on reporting capital gains and los-\nses from a passive activity.\nItems for Special Treatment\n• Transactions by a securities dealer. \nSee section 475 and Rev.

See the \nInstructions for Form 8949 for detailed \ninformation about how to report the dis-\nposition of a market discount bond.\nContingent Payment Debt \nInstruments\nAny gain recognized on the sale, ex-\nchange, or retirement of a taxable con-\ntingent payment debt instrument subject \nto the noncontingent bond method is \ntreated as interest income rather than as \ncapital gain, even if you hold the debt \ninstrument as a capital asset. If you sell \na taxable contingent payment debt in-\nstrument subject to the noncontingent \nbond method at a loss, your loss is an or-\ndinary loss to the extent of your prior \noriginal issue discount (OID) inclusions \non the debt instrument. If the debt in-\nstrument is a capital asset, treat any loss \nthat is more than your prior OID inclu-\nsions as a capital loss. See Regulations \nsection 1.1275-4(b) for exceptions to \nthese rules.\nIf you received a Form 1099-B (or \nsubstitute statement) reporting the sale \nof a taxable contingent payment debt in-\nstrument subject to the noncontingent \nbond method and the Ordinary box in \nbox 2 is checked, an adjustment may be \nrequired. Report the transaction on Form \n8949 and complete the form’s Work-\nsheet for Contingent Payment Debt In-\nstrument Adjustment in Column (g) to \nfigure the adjustment to enter in column \n(g) of Form 8949.\nSee Pub. 550 or Pub. 1212 for more \ndetails on any special rules or adjust-\nments that might apply.\nWash Sales\nA wash sale occurs when you sell or \notherwise dispose of stock or securities \n(including a contract or option to acquire \nor sell stock or securities) at a loss and, \nwithin 30 days before or after the sale or \ndisposition, you:\n1. Buy substantially identical stock \nor securities,\n2. Acquire substantially identical \nstock or securities in a fully taxable \ntrade,\n3. Enter into a contract or option to \nacquire substantially identical stock or \nsecurities, or\n4. Acquire substantially identical \nstock or securities for your individual re-\ntirement arrangement (IRA) or Roth \nIRA.\nYou can't deduct losses from wash \nsales unless the loss was incurred in the \nordinary course of your business as a \ndealer in stock or securities. The basis of \nthe substantially identical property (or \ncontract or option to acquire such prop-\nerty) is its cost increased by the disal-\nlowed loss (except in the case of (4) ear-\nlier).\nThese wash sale rules don't apply to a \nredemption of shares in a floating-NAV \n(net asset value) money market fund.\nIf you received a Form 1099-B (or \nsubstitute statement), box 1g of that \nform will generally show whether there \nwas any nondeductible wash sale loss \nand its amount if:\n• The stock or securities sold were \ncovered securities (defined in the in-\nstructions for Form 8949, column (e)), \nand\n• The substantially identical stock or \nsecurities you bought had the same CU-\nSIP number as the stock or securities \nyou sold and were bought in the same \naccount as the stock or securities you \nD-5\n",
        "sold. (CUSIP numbers are security iden-\ntification numbers.)\nHowever, you can't deduct a loss from a \nwash sale even if it isn't reported on \nForm 1099-B (or substitute statement). \nFor more details on wash sales, see Pub. \n550.\nReport a wash sale transaction in Part \nI or Part II (depending on how long you \nowned the stock or securities) of Form \n8949 with the appropriate box checked. \nComplete all columns. Enter “W” in col-\numn (f). Enter as a positive number in \ncolumn (g) the amount of the loss not al-\nlowed. See the instructions for Form \n8949, columns (f), (g), and (h).\nTraders in Securities\nYou are a trader in securities if you are \nengaged in the business of buying and \nselling securities for your own account. \nTo be engaged in business as a trader in \nsecurities, all of the following state-\nments must be true.\n• You must seek to profit from daily \nmarket movements in the prices of se-\ncurities and not from dividends, interest, \nor capital appreciation.\n• Your activity must be substantial.\n• You must carry on the activity with \ncontinuity and regularity.\nThe following facts and circumstan-\nces should be considered in determining \nif your activity is a business.\n• Typical holding periods for securi-\nties bought and sold.\n• The frequency and dollar amounts \nof your trades during the year.\n• The extent to which you pursue the \nactivity to produce income for a liveli-\nhood.\n• The amount of time you devote to \nthe activity.\nYou are considered an investor, and \nnot a trader, if your activity doesn't meet \nthe above definition of a business. It \ndoesn't matter whether you call yourself \na trader or a “day trader.”\nLike an investor, a trader must gener-\nally report each sale of securities (taking \ninto account commissions and any other \ncosts of acquiring or disposing of the se-\ncurities) on Form 8949 unless one of the \nexceptions described in the Instructions \nfor Form 8949 applies. However, if a \ntrader previously made the mark-to-mar-\nket election (explained below), each \ntransaction is reported in Part II of Form \n4797 instead of on Form 8949. Regard-\nless of whether a trader reports his or her \ngains and losses on Form 8949 or Form \n4797, the gain or loss from the disposi-\ntion of securities isn't taken into account \nwhen \nfiguring \nnet \nearnings \nfrom \nself-employment on Schedule SE. See \nthe Instructions for Schedule SE for an \nexception that applies to section 1256 \ncontracts.\nThe limitation on investment interest \nexpense that applies to investors doesn't \napply to interest paid or incurred in a \ntrading business. A trader reports inter-\nest expense and other expenses (exclud-\ning commissions and other costs of ac-\nquiring or disposing of securities) from a \ntrading business on Schedule C (instead \nof Schedule A).\nA trader may also hold securities for \ninvestment. The rules for investors will \ngenerally apply to those securities. Allo-\ncate interest and other expenses between \nyour trading business and your invest-\nment securities.\nMark-to-Market Election for \nTraders\nA trader may make an election under \nsection 475(f) to report all gains and los-\nses from securities held in connection \nwith a trading business as ordinary in-\ncome (or loss), including those from se-\ncurities held at the end of the year. Se-\ncurities held at the end of the year are \n“marked to market” by treating them as \nif they were sold for fair market value \non the last business day of the year. \nGenerally, the election must be made by \nthe due date (not including extensions) \nof the tax return for the year prior to the \nyear for which the election becomes ef-\nfective. To be effective for 2023, the \nelection must have been made by the \ndue date of your 2022 return (not count-\ning extensions).\nStarting with the year the election be-\ncomes effective, a trader reports all \ngains and losses from securities held in \nconnection with the trading business, in-\ncluding securities held at the end of the \nyear, in Part II of Form 4797. If you pre-\nviously made the election, see the In-\nstructions for Form 4797. For details on \nmaking the mark-to-market election for \n2023, see Pub. 550 or Rev. Proc. 99-17, \nwhich starts on the bottom of page 52 of \nInternal Revenue Bulletin 1999-7 at \nIRS.gov/pub/irs-irbs/irb99-07.pdf.\nIf you hold securities for investment, \nyou must identify them as such in your \nrecords on the day you acquired them \n(for example, by holding the securities \nin a separate brokerage account). Securi-\nties that you hold for investment aren't \nmarked to market.\nShort Sales\nA short sale is a contract to sell property \nyou borrowed for delivery to a buyer. At \na later date, you either buy substantially \nidentical property and deliver it to the \nlender or deliver property that you held \nbut didn't want to transfer at the time of \nthe sale.\nExample. You think the value of \nXYZ stock will drop. You borrow 10 \nshares from your broker and sell them \nfor $100. This is a short sale. You later \nbuy 10 shares for $80 and deliver them \nto your broker to close the short sale. \nYour gain is $20 ($100 − $80).\nHolding period. Usually, your holding \nperiod is the amount of time you actual-\nly held the property eventually delivered \nto the broker or lender to close the short \nsale. However, your gain when closing a \nshort sale is short term if you (a) held \nsubstantially identical property for 1 \nyear or less on the date of the short sale, \nor (b) acquired property substantially \nidentical to the property sold short after \nthe short sale but on or before the date \nyou close the short sale. If you held sub-\nstantially identical property for more \nthan 1 year on the date of a short sale, \nany loss realized on the short sale is a \nlong-term capital loss, even if the prop-\nerty used to close the short sale was held \n1 year or less.\nReporting a short sale. Report any \nshort sale on Form 8949 in the year it \ncloses.\nIf a short sale closed in 2023 but you \ndidn't get a 2023 Form 1099-B (or sub-\nstitute statement) for it because you en-\ntered into it before 2011, report it on \nForm 8949 in Part I with box C checked \nor Part II with box F checked (whichev-\ner applies). In column (a), enter (for ex-\nample) “100 sh. XYZ Co.—2010 short \nsale closed.” Fill in the other columns \naccording to their instructions. Report \nthe short sale the same way if you re-\nceived a 2023 Form 1099-B (or substi-\nD-6\n",
        "tute statement) that doesn't show pro-\nceeds (sales price).\nGain or Loss From Options\nReport on Form 8949 gain or loss from \nthe closing or expiration of an option \nthat isn't a section 1256 contract but is a \ncapital asset in your hands. If an option \nyou purchased expired, enter the expira-\ntion date in column (c) and enter “EX-\nPIRED” in column (d). If an option that \nwas granted (written) expired, enter the \nexpiration date in column (b) and enter \n“EXPIRED” in column (e). Fill in the \nother columns according to their instruc-\ntions. See Pub. 550 for details.\nIf a call option you sold after 2013 \nwas exercised, the option premium you \nreceived will be reflected in the pro-\nceeds shown in box 1d of the Form \n1099-B (or substitute statement) you re-\nceived. If you sold the call option before \n2014, the option premium you received \nmay not be reflected on Form 1099-B. If \nit isn't, enter the premium as a positive \nnumber in column (g) of Form 8949. \nEnter “E” in column (f).\nExample. For $10 in 2013, you sold \nJoe an option to buy one share of XYZ \nstock for $80. Joe later exercised the op-\ntion. The Form 1099-B you get shows \nthe proceeds to be $80. Enter $80 in col-\numn (d) of Form 8949. Enter “E” in col-\numn (f) and $10 in column (g). Com-\nplete the other columns according to the \ninstructions.\nNAV Method for Money \nMarket Funds\nIf you have a capital gain or loss deter-\nmined under the net asset value (NAV) \nmethod with respect to shares in an NAV \nmoney market fund, report the capital \ngain or loss on Form 8949, Part I, with \nbox C checked. Enter the name of each \nfund followed by “(NAV)” in column \n(a). Enter the net gain or loss in column \n(h). Leave all other columns blank. See \nthe Instructions for Form 8949.\nUndistributed Capital Gains\nInclude on Schedule D, line 11, the \namount from box 1a of Form 2439. This \nrepresents your share of the undistrib-\nuted long-term capital gains of the regu-\nlated investment company (including a \nmutual fund) or real estate investment \ntrust.\nIf there is an amount in box 1b of \nForm 2439, include that amount on \nline 11 of the Unrecaptured Section \n1250 Gain Worksheet if you complete \nline 19 of Schedule D.\nIf there is an amount in box 1c of \nForm 2439, see Exclusion of Gain on \nQualified Small Business (QSB) Stock, \nlater.\nIf there is an amount in box 1d of \nForm 2439, include that amount on \nline 4 of the 28% Rate Gain Worksheet \nif you complete line 18 of Schedule D.\nInclude on Schedule 3 (Form 1040), \nline 13a, the tax paid as shown in box 2 \nof Form 2439. Add to the basis of your \nstock the excess of the amount included \nin income over the amount of the credit \nfor the tax paid. See Pub. 550 for details.\nInstallment Sales\nIf you sold property (other than publicly \ntraded stocks or securities) at a gain and \nyou will receive a payment in a tax year \nafter the year of sale, you must generally \nreport the sale on the installment method \nunless you elect not to. Use Form 6252 \nto report the sale on the installment \nmethod. Also, use Form 6252 to report \nany payment received in 2023 from a \nsale made in an earlier year that you re-\nported on the installment method.\nTo elect out of the installment meth-\nod, report the full amount of the gain on \nForm 8949 on a timely filed return (in-\ncluding extensions) for the year of the \nsale. If your original return was filed on \ntime, you can make the election on an \namended return filed no later than 6 \nmonths after the due date of your return \n(excluding extensions). Enter “Filed pur-\nsuant to section 301.9100-2” at the top \nof the amended return.\nDemutualization of Life \nInsurance Companies\nDemutualization of a life insurance \ncompany occurs when a mutual life in-\nsurance company changes to a stock \ncompany. If you were a policyholder or \nannuitant of the mutual company, you \nmay have received either stock in the \nstock company or cash in exchange for \nyour equity interest in the mutual com-\npany.\nIf the demutualization transaction \nqualifies as a tax-free reorganization, no \ngain or loss is recognized on the ex-\nchange of your equity interest in the mu-\ntual company for stock. The company \ncan advise you if the transaction is a \ntax-free reorganization. Your holding \nperiod for the new stock includes the pe-\nriod you held an equity interest in the \nmutual company. If you received cash in \nexchange for your equity interest, you \nmust recognize any capital gain. If you \nheld the equity interest for more than 1 \nyear, report the gain as a long-term capi-\ntal gain in Part II of Form 8949. If you \nheld the equity interest for 1 year or less, \nreport the gain as a short-term capital \ngain in Part I of Form 8949. Be sure the \nappropriate box is checked at the top of \nForm 8949.\nIf the demutualization transaction \ndoesn't qualify as a tax-free reorganiza-\ntion, you must recognize a capital gain \nor loss. If you held the equity interest for \nmore than 1 year, report the gain or loss \nas a long-term capital gain or loss in Part \nII of Form 8949. If you held the equity \ninterest for 1 year or less, report the gain \nor loss as a short-term capital gain or \nloss in Part I of Form 8949. Be sure the \nappropriate box is checked at the top of \nForm 8949. Your holding period for the \nnew stock begins on the day after you \nreceived the stock.\nSmall Business (Section \n1244) Stock\nReport an ordinary loss from the sale, \nexchange, or worthlessness of small \nbusiness (section 1244) stock on Form \n4797. However, if the total loss is more \nthan the maximum amount that can be \ntreated as an ordinary loss for the year \n($50,000 or, on a joint return, $100,000), \nalso report the transaction on Form 8949 \nas follows.\n1. In column (a), enter “Capital por-\ntion of section 1244 stock loss.”\n2. Complete columns (b) and (c) as \nyou normally would.\n3. In column (d), enter the entire \nsales price of the stock sold.\n4. In column (e), enter the entire ba-\nsis of the stock sold.\n5. Enter “S” in column (f). See the \ninstructions for Form 8949, columns (f), \n(g), and (h).\n6. In column (g), enter the loss you \nclaimed on Form 4797 for this transac-\ntion. Enter it as a positive number.\nD-7\n",
        "7. Complete column (h) according \nto its instructions.\nReport the transaction in Part I or \nPart II of Form 8949 (depending on how \nlong you held the stock) with the appro-\npriate box checked.\nExample. You sold section 1244 \nstock for $1,000. Your basis was \n$60,000. You had held the stock for 3 \nyears. You can claim $50,000 of your \nloss as an ordinary loss on Form 4797. \nTo claim the rest of the loss on Form \n8949, check the appropriate box at the \ntop. Enter $1,000 on Form 8949, Part II, \ncolumn (d). Enter $60,000 in column \n(e). Enter “S” in column (f) and $50,000 \n(the ordinary loss claimed on Form \n4797) in column (g). In column (h), en-\nter ($9,000) ($1,000 − $60,000 + \n$50,000). Put it in parentheses to show it \nis a negative amount.\nExclusion of Gain on \nQualified Small Business \n(QSB) Stock\nSection 1202 allows you to exclude a \nportion of the eligible gain on the sale or \nexchange of QSB stock. The section \n1202 exclusion applies only to QSB \nstock held for more than 5 years. If you \nacquired the QSB stock on or before \nFebruary 17, 2009, you can exclude up \nto 50% of the qualified gain. However, \nyou can exclude up to 60% of the quali-\nfied gain on certain empowerment zone \nbusiness stock for gain attributable to \nperiods on or before December 31, \n2018. The 60% exclusion doesn’t apply \nto gain attributable to periods after De-\ncember 31, 2018. See Empowerment \nZone Business Stock, later.\nIf you acquired the QSB stock after \nFebruary 17, 2009, and before Septem-\nber 28, 2010, you can exclude up to 75% \nof the qualified gain.\nIf you acquired the QSB stock after \nSeptember 27, 2010, you can exclude up \nto 100% of the qualified gain.\nTo be QSB stock, the stock must \nmeet all of the following tests.\n1. It must be stock in a C corpora-\ntion (that is, not S corporation stock).\n2. It must have been originally is-\nsued after August 10, 1993.\n3. As of the date the stock was is-\nsued, the corporation was a domestic C \ncorporation with total gross assets of \n$50 million or less (a) at all times after \nAugust 9, 1993, and before the stock \nwas issued; and (b) immediately after \nthe stock was issued. Gross assets in-\nclude those of any predecessor of the \ncorporation. All corporations that are \nmembers of the same parent-subsidiary \ncontrolled group are treated as one cor-\nporation.\n4. You must have acquired the stock \nat its original issue (either directly or \nthrough an underwriter), either in ex-\nchange for money or other property \n(other than stock) or as pay for services \n(other than as an underwriter) to the cor-\nporation. In certain cases, you may meet \nthis test if you acquired the stock from \nanother person who met the test (such as \nby gift or inheritance) or through a con-\nversion or exchange of QSB stock you \nheld.\n5. During substantially all the time \nyou held the stock:\na.\nThe corporation was a C corpora-\ntion;\nb. At least 80% of the value of the \ncorporation's assets were used in the ac-\ntive conduct of one or more qualified \nbusinesses (defined next); and\nc.\nThe corporation wasn't a foreign \ncorporation, DISC, former DISC, regu-\nlated investment company, real estate in-\nvestment trust, REMIC, FASIT, or coop-\nerative, or a corporation that has made \n(or that has a subsidiary that has made) a \nsection 936 election.\nSSBIC. A specialized small \nbusiness investment company \n(SSBIC) is treated as having \nmet test 5b.\nDefinition of qualified business. A \nqualified business is any business that \nisn't one of the following.\n• A business involving services per-\nformed in the field of health, law, engi-\nneering, architecture, accounting, actua-\nrial science, performing arts, consulting, \nathletics, financial services, or brokerage \nservices.\n• A business whose principal asset is \nthe reputation or skill of one or more \nemployees.\n• A banking, insurance, financing, \nleasing, investing, or similar business.\n• A farming business (including the \nraising or harvesting of trees).\nTIP\n• A business involving the produc-\ntion of products for which percentage \ndepletion can be claimed.\n• A business of operating a hotel, \nmotel, restaurant, or similar business.\nFor more details about limits and ad-\nditional requirements that may apply, \nsee Pub. 550 or section 1202.\nAcquisition date of stock acquired af-\nter February 17, 2009. When you are \ndetermining whether your exclusion is \nlimited to 50%, 75%, or 100% of the \ngain from QSB stock, your acquisition \ndate is considered to be the first day you \nheld the stock (determined after apply-\ning the holding period rules in section \n1223).\nEmpowerment Zone Business \nStock\nYou can generally exclude up to 60% of \nyour gain from the sale or exchange of \nQSB stock held for more than 5 years if \nyou meet the following additional re-\nquirements.\n1. The stock you sold or exchanged \nwas stock in a corporation that qualified \nas an empowerment zone business dur-\ning substantially all of the time you held \nthe stock.\n2. You acquired the stock after De-\ncember 21, 2000, and before February \n18, 2009.\n3. The gain from the sale or ex-\nchange of the stock is attributable to pe-\nriods on or before December 31, 2018.\nRequirement 1 will still be met if the \ncorporation ceased to qualify after the \n5-year period that began on the date you \nacquired the stock. However, the gain \nthat qualifies for the 60% exclusion can't \nbe more than the gain you would have \nhad if you had sold the stock on the date \nthe corporation ceased to qualify.\nStock acquired after February 17, \n2009. You can exclude up to 75% of \nyour gain if you acquired the stock after \nFebruary 17, 2009, and before Septem-\nber 28, 2010.\nYou can exclude up to 100% of your \ngain if you acquired the stock after Sep-\ntember 27, 2010.\nMore information.

        "Pass-Through Entities\nIf you held an interest in a pass-through \nentity (a partnership, S corporation, \ncommon trust fund, or mutual fund or \nother regulated investment company) \nthat sold QSB stock, to qualify for the \nexclusion you must have held the inter-\nest on the date the pass-through entity \nacquired the QSB stock and at all times \nthereafter until the stock was sold.\nHow To Report\nReport the sale or exchange of the QSB \nstock on Form 8949, Part II, with the ap-\npropriate box checked, as you would if \nyou weren't taking the exclusion. Then \nenter “Q” in column (f) and enter the \namount of the excluded gain as a nega-\ntive number in column (g). Put it in pa-\nrentheses to show it is negative. See the \ninstructions for Form 8949, columns (f), \n(g), and (h). Complete all remaining col-\numns. If you are completing line 18 of \nSchedule D, enter as a positive number \nthe amount of your allowable exclusion \non line 2 of the 28% Rate Gain Work-\nsheet; if you excluded 60% of the gain, \nenter 2/3 of the exclusion; if you exclu-\nded 75% of the gain, enter 1/3 of the ex-\nclusion; if you excluded 100% of the \ngain, don't enter an amount.\nGain from Form 1099-DIV.

Figure the amount of gain \ntreated as unrecaptured section 1250 \ngain for installment payments received \nin 2023 as the smaller of (a) the amount \nfrom line 26 or line 37 of your 2023 \nForm 6252, whichever applies; or (b) \nthe amount of unrecaptured section 1250 \ngain remaining to be reported. This \namount is generally the total unrecap-\ntured section 1250 gain for the sale re-\nduced by all gain reported in prior years \n(excluding section 1250 ordinary in-\ncome recapture). However, if you chose \nnot to treat all of the gain from payments \nreceived after May 6, 1997, and before \nAugust 24, 1999, as unrecaptured sec-\ntion 1250 gain, use only the amount you \nchose to treat as unrecaptured section \n1250 gain for those payments to reduce \nthe total unrecaptured section 1250 gain \nremaining to be reported for the sale.

        "Examinations, Appeals, Collections, and Refunds\nExaminations (Audits) \nWe accept most taxpayers’ returns as fled. \nIf we inquire about your return or select it \nfor examination, it does not suggest that \nyou are dishonest. The inquiry or \nexamination may or may not result in more \ntax. We may close your case without \nchange; or, you may receive a refund. \nThe process of selecting a return for \nexamination usually begins in one of two \nways. First, we use computer programs to \nidentify returns that may have incorrect \namounts. These programs may be based \non information returns, such as Forms \n1099 and W-2, on studies of past \nexaminations, or on certain issues \nidentifed by compliance projects. Second, \nwe use information from outside sources \nthat indicates that a return may have \nincorrect amounts. These sources may \ninclude newspapers, public records, and \nindividuals. If we determine that the \ninformation is accurate and reliable, we \nmay use it to select a return for \nexamination. \nPublication 556, Examination of Returns, \nAppeal Rights, and Claims for Refund, \nexplains the rules and procedures that we \nfollow in examinations. The following \nsections give an overview of how we \nconduct examinations. \nBy Mail \nWe handle many examinations and \ninquiries by mail. We will send you a letter \nwith either a request for more information \nor a reason why we believe a change to \nyour return may be needed. You can \nrespond by mail or you can request a \npersonal interview with an examiner. If you \nmail us the requested information or \nprovide an explanation, we may or may not \nagree with you, and we will explain the \nreasons for any changes. Please do not \nhesitate to write to us about anything you \ndo not understand. \nBy Interview \nIf we notify you that we will conduct your \nexamination through a personal interview, \nor you request such an interview, you have \nthe right to ask that the examination take \nplace at a reasonable time and place that is \nconvenient for both you and the IRS. If our \nexaminer proposes any changes to your \nreturn, he or she will explain the reasons for \nthe changes. If you do not agree with these \nchanges, you can meet with the examiner’s \nsupervisor. \nRepeat Examinations \nIf we examined your return for the same \nitems in either of the 2 previous years and \nproposed no change to your tax liability, \nplease contact us as soon as possible so \nwe can see if we should discontinue the \nexamination. \nAppeals\nIf you do not agree with the examiner’s \nproposed changes, you can appeal them to \nthe Appeals Offce of the IRS. Most \ndifferences can be settled without \nexpensive and time-consuming court trials. \nYour appeal rights are explained in detail in \nboth Publication 5, Your Appeal Rights and \nHow To Prepare a Protest If You Don’t \nAgree, and Publication 556, Examination of \nReturns, Appeal Rights, and Claims for \nRefund.\nIf you do not wish to use the Appeals \nOffce or disagree with its fndings, you \nmay be able to take your case to the U.S. \nTax Court, U.S. Court of Federal Claims, or \nthe U.S. District Court where you live. If \nyou take your case to court, the IRS will \nhave the burden of proving certain facts if \nyou kept adequate records to show your \ntax liability, cooperated with the IRS, and \nmeet certain other conditions. If the court \nagrees with you on most issues in your \ncase and fnds that our position was largely \nunjustifed, you may be able to recover \nsome of your administrative and litigation \ncosts. You will not be eligible to recover \nthese costs unless you tried to resolve your \ncase administratively, including going \nthrough the appeals system, and you gave \nus the information necessary to resolve the \ncase. \nCollections \nPublication 594, The IRS Collection \nProcess, explains your rights and \nresponsibilities regarding payment of \nfederal taxes. It describes: \n• What to do when you owe taxes. It \ndescribes what to do if you get a tax bill \nand what to do if you think your bill is \nwrong. It also covers making installment \npayments, delaying collection action, \nand submitting an offer in compromise. \n• IRS collection actions. It covers liens, \nreleasing a lien, levies, releasing a levy, \nseizures and sales, and release of \nproperty. \n• IRS certifcation to the State Department \nof a seriously delinquent tax debt, which \nwill generally result in denial of a \npassport application and may lead to \nrevocation of a passport.\nYour collection appeal rights are explained \nin detail in Publication 1660, Collection \nAppeal Rights. \nInnocent Spouse Relief \nGenerally, both you and your spouse are \neach responsible for paying the full \namount of tax, interest, and penalties due \non your joint return. However, if you \nqualify for innocent spouse relief, you may \nbe relieved of part or all of the joint \nliability. To request relief, you must fle \nForm 8857, Request for Innocent Spouse \nRelief. For more information on innocent \nspouse relief, see Publication 971, Innocent \nSpouse Relief, and Form 8857.  \nPotential Third Party Contacts \nGenerally, the IRS will deal directly with you \nor your duly authorized representative. \nHowever, we sometimes talk with other \npersons if we need information that you \nhave been unable to provide, or to verify \ninformation we have received. If we do \ncontact other persons, such as a neighbor, \nbank, employer, or employees, we will \ngenerally need to tell them limited \ninformation, such as your name. The law \nprohibits us from disclosing any more \ninformation than is necessary to obtain or \nverify the information we are seeking. Our \nneed to contact other persons may \ncontinue as long as there is activity in your \ncase. If we do contact other persons, you \nhave a right to request a list of those \ncontacted. Your request can be made by \ntelephone, in writing, or during a personal \ninterview. \nRefunds \nYou may fle a claim for refund if you think \nyou paid too much tax. You must generally \nfle the claim within 3 years from the date \nyou fled your original return or 2 years from \nthe date you paid the tax, whichever is \nlater. The law generally provides for interest \non your refund if it is not paid within 45 \ndays of the date you fled your return or \nclaim for refund. Publication 556, \nExamination of Returns, Appeal Rights, \nand Claims for Refund, has more \ninformation on refunds.\nIf you were due a refund but you did not \nfle a return, you generally must fle your \nreturn within 3 years from the date the \nreturn was due (including extensions) to get \nthat refund. \nTaxpayer Advocate Service  \nTAS is an independent organization within \nthe IRS that can help protect your taxpayer \nrights. We can offer you help if your tax \nproblem is causing a hardship, or you’ve \ntried but haven’t been able to resolve your \nproblem with the IRS.

Form 1040-C is a \ncontinuous use form. Filers will make an entry at the top of \nthe form to identify the tax year.\nWe will revise these instructions annually to show \ninflation-adjusted items for various Code provisions.\nFormer U.S. citizens and former U.S. long-term resi-\ndents. If you expatriate or terminate your long-term \nresidency in 2024, you must file Form 8854, Initial and Annual \nExpatriation Statement, with your 2024 income tax return. \nYou may also be subject to income tax under section 877A \non the net unrealized gain on your property as if the property \nhad been sold on the day before your expatriation date. You \nfigure this tax on Form 8854. For more details, see the Form \n8854 and its instructions at IRS.gov/Form8854. Also, see \nPub. 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens.\nSocial security or Medicare taxes withheld in error.

See Additional information, later.\nAlien status rules. If you are not a citizen of the United \nStates, specific rules apply to determine if you are a resident \nor nonresident alien for tax purposes. Intent is not a factor in \ndetermining your residency status.\nYou are considered a resident alien if you meet either the \ngreen card test or the substantial presence test. However, \neven though you otherwise would meet the substantial \npresence test, you will not be considered a U.S. resident if \nyou qualify for the closer connection to a foreign country \nexception or you are able to qualify as a nonresident alien by \nreason of a tax treaty. These tests and the exception are \ndiscussed in the instructions for Part I—Explanation of \nStatus—Resident or Nonresident Alien, later.\nTIP\nTIP\nJan 5, 2024\nCat. No. 11311Q\n",
        "Final Return Required\nA Form 1040-C is not a final return. You must file a final \nincome tax return after your tax year ends.\nIf you are a U.S. citizen or resident alien on the last day of \nthe year, you should file Form 1040 (or 1040-SR) reporting \nyour worldwide income. If you are not a U.S. citizen or \nresident alien on the last day of the year, you should file Form \n1040-NR. However, certain individuals who were resident \naliens at the beginning of the tax year but nonresident aliens \nat the end of the tax year must file a “dual-status” return. See \nDual-status tax year, later.\nAny tax you pay with Form 1040-C counts as a credit \nagainst tax on your final return. Any overpayment shown on \nForm 1040-C will be refunded only if and to the extent your \nfinal return for the tax year shows an overpayment.\nNote. There are some tax items that are not addressed on \nForm 1040-C or in these instructions that must be taken into \naccount on your final return. For example, if you are a Group I \n(resident alien) filer, you must reconcile any advance \npayments of the premium tax credit with the premium tax \ncredit allowed on your tax return. See Form 8962, Premium \nTax Credit, and its instructions, for more information.\nCertificate of Compliance\nThe issuance of a certificate of compliance is not a \nfinal determination of your tax liability. If it is later \ndetermined that you owe more tax, you will have to \npay the additional tax due\nForm 1040-C or Form 2063. If you are an alien, you should \nnot leave the United States or any of its possessions without \ngetting a certificate of compliance from your IRS Field \nAssistance Area Director on Form 1040-C or Form 2063, U.S. \nDeparting Alien Income Tax Statement, unless you meet one \nof the Exceptions, explained later.\nYou can file the shorter Form 2063 if you have filed all U.S. \nincome tax returns you were required to file, you paid any tax \ndue, and either of the following applies.\n• You have no taxable income for the year of departure and \nfor the preceding year (if the time for filing the earlier year's \nreturn has not passed).\n• You are a resident alien with taxable income for the \npreceding year or for the year of departure, but the Area \nDirector has decided that your leaving will not hinder \ncollecting the tax.\nExceptions. You do not need a certificate of compliance if \nany of the following applies.\n1. You are a representative of a foreign government who \nholds a diplomatic passport, a member of the \nrepresentative's household, a servant who accompanies the \nrepresentative, an employee of an international organization \nor foreign government whose pay for official services is \nexempt from U.S. taxes and who has no other U.S. source \nincome, or a member of the employee's household who has \nno income from U.S. sources. However, if you signed a \nwaiver of nonimmigrant's privileges as a condition of holding \nboth your job and your status as an immigrant, this exception \ndoes not apply, and you must get a certificate.\n2. You are a student, industrial trainee, or exchange \nvisitor, or the spouse or child of such an individual. To qualify \nfor this exception, you must have an F-1, F-2, H-3, H-4, J-1, \nCAUTION\n!\nJ-2, or Q visa. Additionally, you must not have received any \nincome from sources in the United States other than:\na. Allowances covering expenses incident to your study \nor training in the United States (including expenses for travel, \nmaintenance, and tuition);\nb. The value of any services or accommodations \nfurnished incident to such study or training;\nc. Income from employment authorized under U.S. \nimmigration laws; or\nd. Interest on deposits, but only if that interest is not \neffectively connected with a U.S. trade or business.\n3. You are a student, or the spouse or child of a student, \nwith an M-1 or M-2 visa. To qualify, you must not have \nreceived any income from sources in the United States other \nthan:\na. Income from employment authorized under U.S. \nimmigration laws, or\nb. Interest on deposits, but only if that interest is not \neffectively connected with a U.S. trade or business.\n4. Any of the following applies.\na. You are on a pleasure trip and have a B-2 visa.\nb. You are on a business trip, have a B-1 visa or a \ncombined B-1/B-2 visa, and do not stay in the United States \nor any of its possessions for more than 90 days during the tax \nyear.\nc. You are passing through the United States or any of its \npossessions, including travel on a C-1 visa or under a \ncontract, such as a bond agreement, between a \ntransportation line and the U.S. Attorney General.\nd. You are admitted on a border-crossing identification \ncard.\ne. You do not need to carry passports, visas, or \nborder-crossing identification cards because you are (i) \nvisiting for pleasure or (ii) visiting for business and do not stay \nin the United States or any of its possessions for more than \n90 days during the tax year.\nf.\nYou are a resident of Canada or Mexico who \ncommutes frequently to the United States to work and your \nwages are subject to income tax withholding.\ng. You are a military trainee admitted for instruction under \nthe Department of Defense and you will leave the United \nStates on official military travel orders.\nHowever, exception 4 does not apply if the Area Director \nbelieves you had taxable income during the current tax year \nthrough your departure date or the preceding tax year and \nyour leaving the United States would hinder collecting the \ntax.\nHow To Get the Certificate\nTo get a certificate of compliance you must obtain a sailing or \ndeparture permit. To obtain a permit, file Form 1040-C or \nForm 2063 (whichever applies) with your local IRS office \nbefore you leave the United States.\nYou must make an appointment for assistance at the \nlocal office. You can call 844-545-5640 between the \nhours of 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. local time to make the \nappointment. Depending on the time of year, some offices \nmay not have available appointments within the 2 to 4 week \ntime frame you must file so allow enough time to schedule \nyour appointment before your departure date.\nCAUTION\n!\n2\nInstructions for Form 1040-C (Rev. 01-2024)\n",
        "You must also pay all the tax shown as due on Form \n1040-C and any taxes due for past years. See Paying Taxes \nand Obtaining Refunds, later.\nIt is advisable for aliens who have been working in the \nUnited States to get the permit from an IRS office in the area \nof their employment, but it also can be obtained from an IRS \noffice in the area of their departure.\nWhen To Get a Sailing or Departure Permit\nYou should get your sailing or departure permit at least 2 \nweeks before you plan to leave. You cannot apply earlier than \n30 days before your planned departure date. Do not wait \nuntil the last minute in case there are unexpected problems.\nForms To File\nIf you must get a sailing or departure permit, you must file \nForm 2063 or Form 1040-C. Both forms have a “certificate of \ncompliance” section. When the certificate of compliance is \nsigned by an agent of the Field Assistance Area Director, it \ncertifies that your U.S. tax obligations have been satisfied \naccording to available information. Your Form 1040-C copy of \nthe signed certificate, or the one detached from Form 2063, \nis your sailing or departure permit.\nForm 2063\nThis is a short form that asks for certain information but does \nnot include a tax computation. The following departing aliens \ncan get their sailing or departure permits by filing Form 2063:\n• Aliens, whether resident or nonresident, who have had no \ntaxable income for the tax year up to and including the date \nof departure and for the preceding year, if the period for filing \nthe income tax return for that year has not expired.\n• Resident aliens who have received taxable income during \nthe tax year or preceding year and whose departure will not \nhinder the collection of any tax. However, if the IRS has \ninformation indicating that the aliens are leaving to avoid \npaying their income tax, they must file a Form 1040-C.\nAliens in either of these categories who have not filed an \nincome tax return or paid income tax for any tax year must \nfile the return and pay the income tax before they can be \nissued a sailing or departure permit on Form 2063. The \nsailing or departure permit detached from Form 2063 can be \nused for all departures during the current year. However, the \nIRS may cancel the sailing or departure permit for any later \ndeparture if it believes the collection of income tax is \njeopardized by that later departure.\nForm 1040-C\nIf you must get a sailing or departure permit and you do not \nqualify to file Form 2063, you must file Form 1040-C. \nOrdinarily, all income received or reasonably expected to be \nreceived during the tax year up to and including the date of \ndeparture must be reported on Form 1040-C and the tax on it \nmust be paid. When you pay any tax shown as due on the \nForm 1040-C, and you file all returns and pay all tax due for \nprevious years, you will receive a sailing or departure permit.\nThe IRS may permit you to furnish a bond \nguaranteeing payment instead of paying the taxes \nfor certain years. The sailing or departure permit \nissued under the conditions in this paragraph is only for the \nspecific departure for which it is issued.\nTIP\nLawful permanent resident aliens (green card \nholders) with no definite plans to return to the United \nStates must notify the Department of Homeland \nSecurity of their termination of residency and file Form 8854, \nif they:\n• Plan to surrender their green card, and\n• Have been a lawful permanent resident in at least 8 \ntaxable years during the previous 15 taxable years, including \nthe taxable year during which they surrender their green card.\nSee the Expatriation Tax information in Pub. 519, for more \ndetailed information.\nPapers To Submit\nGetting your sailing or departure permit will go faster if you \nbring to your appointment at the IRS office papers and \ndocuments related to your income and your stay in the United \nStates. Bring the following records with you if they apply:\n• Your passport and alien registration card or visa.\n• Copies of your U.S. income tax returns filed for the past 2 \nyears.\n• If you were in the United States for less than 2 years, bring \nthe income tax returns you filed for that period.\n• Receipts for income taxes paid on these returns.\n• Receipts, bank records, canceled checks, and other \ndocuments that prove your deductions, business expenses, \nand dependents claimed on your returns.\n• A statement from each employer showing wages paid and \ntax withheld from January 1 of the current year to the date of \ndeparture if you were an employee.\n• If you were self-employed, you must bring a statement of \nincome and expenses up to the date you plan to leave.\n• Proof of estimated tax payments for the past year and this \nyear.\n• Documents showing any gain or loss from the sale of \npersonal property, including capital assets and merchandise.\n• Documents relating to scholarship or fellowship grants \nincluding verification of the grantor, source, and purpose of \nthe grant.\n• Documents indicating you qualify for any special tax treaty \nbenefits claimed.\n• Document verifying your date of departure from the United \nStates, such as an airline ticket.\n• Document verifying your U.S. taxpayer identification \nnumber, such as a social security card or an IRS-issued CP \n565 showing your individual taxpayer identification number \n(ITIN).\nIf you are married and reside in a community property \nstate, also bring the above-listed documents for your \nspouse. This applies whether or not your spouse \nrequires a certificate.\nReturning to the United States\nIf you furnish the IRS with information showing, to the \nsatisfaction of the IRS, that you intend to return to the United \nStates and that your departure does not jeopardize the \ncollection of income tax, you can get a sailing or departure \npermit by filing Form 1040-C without having to pay the tax \nshown on it. You must, however, file all income tax returns \nthat have not yet been filed as required, and pay all income \ntax that is due on these returns.\nCAUTION\n!\nCAUTION\n!\nInstructions for Form 1040-C (Rev. 01-2024)\n3\n",
        "Your Form 1040-C must include all income received and \nreasonably expected to be received during the entire year of \ndeparture. The sailing or departure permit issued with this \nForm 1040-C can be used for all departures during the \ncurrent year. However, the IRS may cancel the sailing or \ndeparture permit for any later departure if the payment of \nincome tax appears to be in jeopardy.\nJoint Return on Form 1040-C\nDeparting husbands and wives who are nonresident aliens \ncannot file joint returns. However, if one spouse is a resident \nalien, they can file a joint return on Form 1040-C if:\n• Both spouses can reasonably be expected to qualify to file \na joint return at the normal close of their tax year.\n• The tax years of the spouses end at the same time.\nPaying Taxes and Obtaining Refunds\nExcept when a bond is furnished, or the IRS is satisfied that \nyour departure does not jeopardize the collection of income \ntax, you must pay all tax shown as due on the Form 1040-C \nat the time of filing it. You must also pay any taxes due for \npast years. If the tax computation on Form 1040-C results in \nan overpayment, there is no tax to pay at the time you file that \nreturn. However, the IRS cannot provide a refund at the time \nof departure. If you are due a refund, you must file Form 1040 \nor Form 1040-NR, as appropriate, at the end of the tax year.\nFiling Annual U.S. Income Tax Returns\nForm 1040-C is not an annual U.S. income tax return. If an \nincome tax return is required by law, that return must be filed \neven though a Form 1040-C has already been filed. The tax \npaid with Form 1040- C should be taken as a credit against \nthe tax liability for the entire tax year on your annual U.S. \nincome tax return.\nIdentifying Number\nYou are generally required to enter your social security \nnumber (SSN). To get an SSN for a nonresident alien \nspouse, apply at an office of the U.S. Social Security \nAdministration (SSA). For more, information go to SSA.gov or \ncall 800-772-121 .\nIf you do not have an SSN and are not eligible to get one, \nyou must apply for an individual taxpayer identification \nnumber (ITIN). For details on how to do so, see Form W-7 \nand its instructions. It usually takes about 4–6 weeks to get \nan ITIN.\nIf you already have an ITIN, enter it wherever your SSN is \nrequested on your tax return. If you are required to include \nanother person’s SSN on your return and that person does \nnot have and cannot get an SSN, enter that person’s ITIN.\nAn ITIN is for tax use only. It does not entitle you to \nsocial security benefits or change your employment \nor immigration status under U.S. law.\nTo find an IRS office, click on Contact Your Local IRS \nOffice and enter your zip code to find the nearest office.\nCAUTION\n!\nPlease note that all Taxpayer Assistance Centers \n(TACs) operate by appointment. Services are limited \nand not all services are available at every TAC office. \nCall 844-545-5640 to schedule an appointment.\nRemember that you must visit an IRS office at least 2 \nweeks (but no more than 30 days) before you leave the \nUnited States, so make sure you call for an appointment well \nbefore those time frames.\nPlease be prepared to furnish your anticipated date of \ndeparture and bring the following records with you if they \napply.\n1.

        "Protecting Workers from the \nHazards of Asbestos-Containing \nFlooring Material Maintenance\nMany resilient flooring tiles contain asbestos, a mineral fiber used in numerous \nbuilding materials before its dangerous health effects were discovered. A hazard \nexists for workers who buff or wax flooring material containing asbestos. Any \nfloor tiles installed prior to 1980 should be presumed to contain asbestos — unless \nconfirmed to be asbestos-free by a laboratory — and the proper protective actions \nshould be taken. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has \nregulations to protect workers from asbestos.\nWhat is the hazard?\nThe equipment used during the care or \nmaintenance of asbestos-containing flooring tiles \nhas an abrasive pad which runs at high speeds, \nand can release tiny asbestos fibers into the air.\nThe airborne fibers can then be inhaled by \nworkers without knowing it, and become trapped \nin their lungs.\nAsbestos is a known human carcinogen and \ncan cause chronic lung disease as well as lung \nand other cancers.\nHow do I know if there is a hazard?\nAirborne asbestos fibers are very small and \ncannot be seen by the naked eye.\nFlooring materials installed prior to 1980 should \nbe presumed to contain asbestos and should be \ntreated as such, unless a piece of the material is \nsent to a reputable laboratory and analyzed for \nasbestos by transmission electron microscopy and \nfound to contain a concentration of less than 1.0%.\nWhat should be done to protect workers?\nWorkers caring for asbestos-containing \nflooring material (general industry) are \nprotected by OSHA’s Asbestos standard, \n29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part \n1910.1001. OSHA has separate asbestos \nstandards for the construction and shipyard \nindustries due to differing working conditions \nand asbestos exposures.\nTraining elements of OSHA’s \nAsbestos Standard\nInitial and annual training must be provided \nin a manner and language that workers can \nunderstand. The training must include: health \neffects of asbestos; locations of asbestos-\ncontaining and presumed asbestos-containing \nmaterials; recognition of damage and deterioration \nof asbestos-containing materials; and the proper \nresponse to fiber release episodes. The following \nelements should be included in this training:\nCare of Asbestos-Containing Flooring Materials\n•\t Do not sand asbestos-containing flooring \nmaterial;\n•\t Use only low-abrasion buffing pads;\n•\t Operate buffers only at speeds lower than \n300 rpm;\n•\t Use wet methods;\n•\t If asbestos-containing flooring material has \nsufficient finish, brushing or dry buffing is \npermissible.\nIf these methods are properly implemented, \npersonal protective equipment (PPE) should not \nbe necessary.\nRecordkeeping\nA record of training and worker notification \nis necessary.

        "Avian Influenza (Bird Flu)\nAvian influenza is divided into two groups based upon the severity of the disease they \nproduce in poultry: low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses and highly pathogenic \navian influenza (HPAI) viruses. LPAI generally cause minor illness, while HPAI viruses are \nhighly contagious and cause high mortality in poultry. Avian influenza viruses do not \ntypically infect humans, however, infrequent human infections with avian influenza have \noccurred. To date, H5N1 viruses have been found in U.S. commercial poultry, backyard \npoultry, and hobbyist bird flocks across multiple U.S. states. This document provides \ninterim recommendations for protecting employees who may be exposed due to an \noutbreak of HPAI in the United States.\nBackground\nAlthough avian influenza viruses have the potential \nto develop into pandemic viruses if they acquire \nthe ability to pass readily from person-to-person, \nto date, there is no evidence of sustained (ongoing) \nspread among people. For the most up-to-date \ninformation on avian influenza, consult the Center \nfor Disease Control and Prevention’s Avian Flu \ninformation page: www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu. \nSymptoms of Avian Flu in Humans\nSymptoms in humans can range from \nasymptomatic or mild illness (e.g., eye redness \nor mild flu-like upper respiratory symptoms) \nto severe illness (e.g., pneumonia) requiring \nhospitalization. Signs and symptoms may include \nfever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, \nmuscle or body aches, headaches, fatigue, and \nshortness of breath or difficulty breathing. Less \ncommon symptoms include diarrhea, nausea, \nvomiting, or seizures. Fever does not always \noccur in humans infected with avian influenza.\nHow People Become Infected\nMost cases of avian influenza infection in humans \nare the result of direct contact with infected \npoultry (e.g., domesticated chickens, ducks, and \nturkeys) or contact with surfaces contaminated \nwith saliva, mucus, or feces from infected poultry. \nDirect exposure happens when virus particles in \naerosolized droplets or dust are inhaled or contact \na person’s mucous membranes, such as their eyes, \nnose, or mouth. Exposure can also occur when a \nperson touches a contaminated surface, object, or \nmaterial and then touches the mouth, nose, or eyes. \nEmployees at Potential Risk of Exposure\n•\t Poultry workers, including workers involved \nin eradication activities (e.g., depopulating \npoultry and disposal)\n•\t Animal handlers other than poultry workers \n(e.g., animal control, zookeepers, veterinarians)\n•\t Laboratory employees who handle \ninfluenza viruses\n•\t Healthcare workers treating patients with \nknown or suspected avian influenza viruses\nRecommendations for Employees at \nRisk of Exposure\n•\t Avoid unprotected contact with poultry and other \nbirds suspected or known to be infected, as well \nas any of the following associated with infected \nbirds: poultry carcasses, \npoultry feces or litter, and \nsurfaces and water that \nmight be contaminated \nwith poultry excretions.\n•\t Use proper hand \nhygiene practices.

But it can \nsave you thousands of dollars. \nMake it your goal to compare at \nleast three loan offers from \ndifferent lenders. \nGet at least three preapprovals\nThe Internet and newspapers are a good place to \nstart your search for mortgage lenders. Contact \nbanks, credit unions, and organizations that might \nspecialize in your situation—like first-time home \nbuyers, veterans, public service workers, or others.\nAsk at least three different lenders for “preapproval.” \nThis means that the lender looks at your finances, \nincluding your credit report, and estimates how \nmuch you can borrow and what interest you’ll \nlikely pay. \nPreapproval lets you try out each lender to see what \nkind of loans and prices it offers. When you get all \nthree preapprovals within a short time, there should \nbe no major impact on your credit score.\nYou’ll come back to these lenders when you’ve \nmade some decisions, and ask them for loan offers.\nShop for loan terms, interest rate \nstructures, and programs\nLoan term: Longer or shorter\nIn general, a longer loan term costs more over the \nlife of the loan. But your monthly payments are \ntypically lower. \n30-year\nMost homebuyers choose a 30-year \nloan because payments can be low.\n15-year\nPayments are typically higher than for \n30-year loans, but your loan is paid \noff in 15 years and the total cost of the \nloan can be lower. \nYou may be able to negotiate a different loan term \nwith your lender, like 20 years, 7 years, or even \nlonger than 30 years.\nLoan interest rate structure: Fixed rate or \nadjustable rate\nFixed-rate loans are common. Your initial payment \nmay be lower with an adjustable-rate loan, but if \ninterest rates rise you might face sharply increased \npayments.\n\t\n§\nFixed-rate mortgage: Your interest rate and \nmonthly payment will stay the same for the life of \nyour loan.\n\t\n§ Adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM): Your interest \nrate typically is fixed for the first few years of \n",

Once the fixed period expires, the rate \nadjusts at regular intervals based on an “index.” \nAn index is a measure of interest rates generally, \nand it reflects trends in the overall economy. \nThis means your payment amount can increase \nor decrease. Details are included in the Loan \nEstimate you receive from the lender.\nLoan program: Conventional, FHA, \nVA, or special program\nThere are many loan programs, and some are set \nup to help make mortgages available to people in \ncertain circumstances or groups.\nMaking a down payment of 5% or more? \nAsk about a Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac eligible \nloan, often called a “conventional” loan. \nMaking only a small down payment? \nAsk about an FHA-insured loan. \nServicemember or veteran? \nAsk about a VA guaranteed loan. \nBuying a home in a rural area? \nAsk about a USDA-sponsored loan. \nFirst-time homebuyer with low or \nmoderate income? \nAsk about loans available through your state’s \nhousing finance agency.\nCompare loan offers\nNow, it’s time to start the official application process. \nAsk your lenders for offers of loans that reflect your \nchoices for loan type, program, and term. Then you’ll \nbe able to make apples-to-apples comparisons.\nFirst, compare the basic parts of the loan:\n\t\n§ What is the term of the loan?\n\t\n§ What is the interest rate?\n\t\n§ What down payment amount is the loan \nbased on?\n\t\n§ How much is the monthly payment? \n\t\n§ For adjustable-rate mortgages, are the payment \nadjustments and the interest rate capped? \nDoes the interest rate go down if market \ninterest rates fall?\nNext, compare the rest of the details that can affect \nyour cost:\n\t\n§ When will my payments pay off my principal?\n\t\n§ Will the payments change over the life of the \nloan? How high can my payment go?\n\t\n§ Does my payment include property taxes \nand insurance? If not, can I afford to pay \nthose separately?\n\t\n§ What costs and fees will be added to my initial \npayment? To my ongoing payment?\n\t\n§ Do I need to pay points (upfront fees that reduce \nyour interest rate)?\n\t\n§ What fees and costs are included in the amount \nI’m borrowing (typical for a “no closing cost” loan)?\n\t\n§ Does the written offer match what I was told \nabout the loan?\n\t\n§ Can I get a better deal on settlement services \nfrom different service providers?\n\t\n§ Can I repay the loan early, or make larger than \nscheduled payments, without penalty?\n",

        " \n \n1 \nPara información en español, visite www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore o escribe a la \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau, 1700 G Street NW, Washington, DC 20552. \n \nA Summary of Your Rights Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act \n \n \n \nThe federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) promotes the accuracy, fairness, and \nprivacy of information in the files of consumer reporting agencies.  There are many types of \nconsumer reporting agencies, including credit bureaus and specialty agencies (such as agencies \nthat sell information about check writing histories, medical records, and rental history records).  \nHere is a summary of your major rights under FCRA.  For more information, including \ninformation about additional rights, go to www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore or write \nto: Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 1700 G Street NW, Washington, DC 20552. \n \n• You must be told if information in your file has been used against you.  Anyone who \nuses a credit report or another type of consumer report to deny your application for credit, \ninsurance, or employment – or to take another adverse action against you – must tell you, \nand must give you the name, address, and phone number of the agency that provided the \ninformation. \n \n• You have the right to know what is in your file.  You may request and obtain all the \ninformation about you in the files of a consumer reporting agency (your “file \ndisclosure”).  You will be required to provide proper identification, which may include \nyour Social Security number.  In many cases, the disclosure will be free.  You are entitled \nto a free file disclosure if: \n \no a person has taken adverse action against you because of information in your \ncredit report; \no you are the victim of identity theft and place a fraud alert in your file; \no your file contains inaccurate information as a result of fraud; \no you are on public assistance; \no you are unemployed but expect to apply for employment within 60 days. \n \nIn addition, all consumers are entitled to one free disclosure every 12 months upon \nrequest from each nationwide credit bureau and from nationwide specialty consumer \nreporting agencies.  See www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore for additional \ninformation. \n \n• You have the right to ask for a credit score.  Credit scores are numerical summaries of \nyour credit-worthiness based on information from credit bureaus.  You may request a \ncredit score from consumer reporting agencies that create scores or distribute scores used \nin residential real property loans, but you will have to pay for it.  In some mortgage \ntransactions, you will receive credit score information for free from the mortgage lender. \n \n• You have the right to dispute incomplete or inaccurate information.  If you identify \ninformation in your file that is incomplete or inaccurate, and report it to the consumer \n",
        " \n \n2 \nreporting agency, the agency must investigate unless your dispute is frivolous.  See \nwww.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore for an explanation of dispute procedures. \n \n• Consumer reporting agencies must correct or delete inaccurate, incomplete, or \nunverifiable information.  Inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information must be \nremoved or corrected, usually within 30 days.  However, a consumer reporting agency \nmay continue to report information it has verified as accurate. \n \n• Consumer reporting agencies may not report outdated negative information.  In \nmost cases, a consumer reporting agency may not report negative information that is \nmore than seven years old, or bankruptcies that are more than 10 years old. \n \n• Access to your file is limited.  A consumer reporting agency may provide information \nabout you only to people with a valid need – usually to consider an application with a \ncreditor, insurer, employer, landlord, or other business.  The FCRA specifies those with a \nvalid need for access. \n \n• You must give your consent for reports to be provided to employers.  A consumer \nreporting agency may not give out information about you to your employer, or a potential \nemployer, without your written consent given to the employer.  Written consent generally \nis not required in the trucking industry.  For more information, go to \nwww.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore. \n \n• You may limit “prescreened” offers of credit and insurance you get based on \ninformation in your credit report.  Unsolicited “prescreened” offers for credit and \ninsurance must include a toll-free phone number you can call if you choose to remove \nyour name and address from the lists these offers are based on.  You may opt out with the \nnationwide credit bureaus at 1-888-567-8688. \n \n• The following FCRA right applies with respect to nationwide consumer reporting \nagencies: \n \nCONSUMERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBTAIN A SECURITY FREEZE \n \nYou have a right to place a “security freeze” on your credit report, which will \nprohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing information in your credit \nreport without your express authorization.  The security freeze is designed to prevent \ncredit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent.  \nHowever, you should be aware that using a security freeze to take control over who gets \naccess to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere \nwith, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make \nregarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of \ncredit. \n \nAs an alternative to a security freeze, you have the right to place an initial or extended \nfraud alert on your credit file at no cost.  An initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is \n",
        " \n \n3 \nplaced on a consumer’s credit file.  Upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer’s \ncredit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer’s identity before \nextending new credit.  If you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended \nfraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting 7 years. \n \nA security freeze does not apply to a person or entity, or its affiliates, or collection \nagencies acting on behalf of the person or entity, with which you have an existing \naccount that requests information in your credit report for the purposes of reviewing or \ncollecting the account.  Reviewing the account includes activities related to account \nmaintenance, monitoring, credit line increases, and account upgrades and enhancements. \n \n• You may seek damages from violators.  If a consumer reporting agency, or, in some \ncases, a user of consumer reports or a furnisher of information to a consumer reporting \nagency violates the FCRA, you may be able to sue in state or federal court. \n \n• Identity theft victims and active duty military personnel have additional rights.  For \nmore information, visit www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore. \n \nStates may enforce the FCRA, and many states have their own consumer reporting laws.  \nIn some cases, you may have more rights under state law.  For more information, contact \nyour state or local consumer protection agency or your state Attorney General.  For \ninformation about your federal rights, contact:  \n \n",
